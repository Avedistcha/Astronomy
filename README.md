# Astronomy
We propose in this project to observe on successive days the position of each of the four major moons of Jupiter: Io, Europe, Ganymede and Callisto to deduce finally their orbital periods (adding on finding the jupeter rotational periode).
##
You will find a sample Matlab code in order to curve fit and get Ganimede moon periode
